and So far, you only have the customer_id, amount, and status from the form.

-> with console.log(typeof rawFormData.amount); -> not a number

You'll notice that amount is of type string and not number. This is because input 
elements with type="number" actually return a string, not a number!

To handle type validation, you have a few options. While you can manually validate types, using a type validation 
library can save you time and effort. For your example, we'll use Zod, a TypeScript-first validation library that 
can simplify this task for you.

Next.js has a Client-side Router Cache that stores the route segments in the user's browser for a time. Along with
